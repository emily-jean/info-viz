<div class="header">
    <p>The Energy Information Administration (EIA) collected monthly data on the Energy Generation and Fuel. Plotting the Net Generation and the Total Fuel Consumption Quanitity, we can look at the number of plants per state. The total fuel comsumption quantity in physical units, year to date, is the total quantity consumed for both electricity and, in the case of combined heat and power plants, process steam production. The Net Generation (of electricity) is the total electrical output net of station service. In the case of cogenerators, this value is intended to include internal consumption of electricity for the purposes of a production process, as well as power put on the grid.
