A Tour through the Visualization Zoo, written by Jeffrey Heer, Michael Bostock, and Vadim Ogievetsky, explores the different visualization methods in which data is displayed through many encodings. The authors write about exploring multiple ways of visualizing a dataset and how challenging it is for any given data set due to the number of visual encodings. By utilizing the same dataset, it was very comprehensible and easy to see the complexities. The article introduced a few newer visualizations such as Q-Q plots and a specific tree layout, the icicle tree.
