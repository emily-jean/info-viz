\section*{1 Dear Data}

In order to visualization my question, I decided to keep track of all of the things that I saw in a day that were beautiful to me. I thought I could gather some substantial data with the following categories: people, animals, plants, weather, objects, art, music, language, literature, and happiness. People, consisted of individuals like my boyfriend, friends at school and outside of school, and family. Although not necessarily weather, I did incorporate things such as "sunsets" in weather, and literature could also consist of articles or short stories rather than just novels. Every tally represented one of these moments. To discover where I might "see more beauty" during my day, I decided to keep track of the location of where I was at the time. Giving insight into what day it was also gave me an interesting idea to see if I think I see more beautiful things during the weekend or during my routinely day.\\

In order to think more abstractly and not fall back on a bar chart or some standard visualization, I thought it was best to group different types of beauty into some category was necessary to give some meaning to the data. I also thought that adding location and the day added another more granular level of detail and could add some interesting interpretation afterwards.
